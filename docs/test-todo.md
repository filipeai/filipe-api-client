## Completed Tests

The following tests have been implemented and verified against the real API:

1. **Basic API Functionality**
   - ✅ Status API
   - ✅ Creating notifications
   - ✅ Retrieving notifications
   - ✅ Listing notifications
   - ✅ Creating notification handlers
   - ✅ Updating notification handlers
   - ✅ Listing notification handlers
   - ✅ Deleting notification handlers
   - ✅ Creating/updating identities
   - ✅ Retrieving identities
   - ✅ Listing identities
   - ✅ Identity-notification integration

2. **WebSocket Functionality**
   - ✅ Connecting to WebSocket with API key
   - ✅ Receiving welcome message
   - ✅ Subscribing to notification sources
   - ✅ Receiving notifications in real-time
   - ✅ Acknowledging notifications
   - ✅ Unsubscribing from notification sources

## Additional Testing Needed

The following areas still need more comprehensive testing:

1. **Processing Records** - Fetching and handling notification processing records.
2. **Error Handling in WebSocket** - More robust testing of error conditions.
3. **Performance and Load Testing** - Testing with multiple clients and high throughput.
4. **Complex Metadata Filters** - Testing notification handlers with more complex metadata filters.
